# ImageProcessing

To perform any action on the images, we first need to be able to get some information from the image to work on.

This information can be in the form of intensity of a pixel or a group of pixels, the lines or the edges formed from these pixels, the corners, etc which forms the features to work with.

This project talks about two of these features: edges and corners

we perform Edge detection and corner detection with filters like Sobel and canny filter.

Then we use these features to find correspondences between two images by comparing corners detected in both.

And finally we arrive on to SIFT(Scale Invariant Feature Transform) and see why its is a great way to extract features form images.
